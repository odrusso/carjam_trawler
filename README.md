# CarJam Trawler
This is a small Python 3.7 application to scrape information about New Zealand cars from the website https://carjam.co.nz/ based on an input of number plates.

## Usage
Create a text file, `new_plates.txt`, with 1 number-plate per line.
Then run `python carjam.py`
This will output a file `test_output.css` with the information.

## Installation
This requires the Python package [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
And the [Chrome Webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
